    "## 0. Motivation of Factor Models <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"0\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The factor approach began in the 1960s with the famous Fama-French research showing that certain categories of stocks outperformed (or underperformed) the general market indexes such as the S&P 500 over long historical periods.  This work extended Bill Sharpe’s single factor CAPM research (earning him a Nobel prize along with Harry Markowitz).   Putting these pieces together gave us the following three factors: \n",
    "\n",
    " * Excess market returns (SP500 – T-Bills), \n",
    " * Value – growth stocks, and \n",
    " * Small minus large cap stocks.\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll call these micro factor factors, since they are specific to firms rather than the economy as a whole.\n",
    " \n",
    "At that time, financial researchers applied traditional OLS regression equations (covered in the next section) to estimate the importance of these factors (loadings) on the return of individual stocks.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, researchers have discovered and published dozens of papers on additional factors as candidates for inclusion in a systematic analysis when forming a portfolio of stocks.  Today, there are over 50 factors that have displayed patterns in return, and there is much attention to observing the state of these factors by firms such as MSCI and other providers of analytical services.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous subsection, we have seen the shift into alternative investment categories by university endowments and more recently by large institutional investors including global pension plans and sovereign wealth funds. These funds have a hybrid nature in that they include multiple risk categories.  For instance, we will explore instruments which contain both interest rate risks and equity risks (during crash periods high yield bond funds generate losses due to bankruptcy and other default risks).  Other hybrids occur in private equity, various categories of hedge funds, real assets, levered debt funds, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "To untangle these complicated investments and in response to the major loss of capital by many investors in the 2008/09 crash period, financial researchers turned to risk factors for systematic investigation of the underlying risks at the asset allocation level. We call these macro-factors – as compared with the micro factors mentioned above.  But the goal is the same:  trace down the underlying risk factors when conducting a portfolio analysis.  Note that what we refer to as factors are equivalent to “features” in machine learning. In notebook five of this online course, we use of a large set of factors/features to estimate the probability of various market conditions over a future time-period – monthly in our example.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The study of macro-factors has led to new methods in an asset allocation or Asset Liability Modeling (ALM).  Rather than describing each of these studies, we have chosen one study for our purposes. Here, we follow the work of Harvard University's endowment and their use of five factors: a) global equity, b) long term U.S. government bonds, c) high yield bonds, d) inflation hedging, and e) currency hedging.   The first three factors are most reasonable since they are surrogates for asset pricing models (earnings, risk free interest rates, and a risk premium).  The other two factors are driven by the importance of international investments by Harvard and the need to address inflation risks due to the linkage of spending by Harvard to future inflation.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss a more systematic approach to estimating the factor loading and employing these loading when forecasting future expected returns for the assets within our portfolio model.  In particular, we will apply a regularized regression with a penalty term to shrink the loadings.  This shrinkage is motivated by the Stein result (paradox) since we are estimating the return for more than 2 asset categories. The best penalty value will be determined by cross validation which useses training and validation to estimate the penalty."

    "## 1. Introduction to Linear Factor Models <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let's introduce the basic linear factor model, and the estimator, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear factor model can be written as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    y_t = {X_t}^T \\beta + \\epsilon_t\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "$t$ is used to index each observation. ${\\bf y} = \\{y_t\\}$ is called the dependent variable for observation $t$ and the vector ${X_t}^T = (X_t^1, X_t^2, \\dots, X_t^m)$ is called the set of factors (statisticians would call them independent or explanatory variables) for observation $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "${\\bf \\beta} = (\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_m)'$ are called the factor loadings. (Statisticians would call them the coefficients.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As in most of finance, the dependent variable $y_t$ will the be the returns of some asset, and the independent variables will the the return of the factors.  We call this a linear factor model because we have assumed a linear relationship between the returns of the factors and the returns of the assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "With historical data, the factor loadings ${\\bf \\beta}$ can be estimated via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*} \n",
    "    \\hat{\\beta}^{\\text{OLS}} = argmin_{\\beta}\\bigg\\{\\sum_{t=1}^{n} (y_t - {X_t}^T {\\bf \\beta})^2 \\bigg\\}.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we run the OLS estimation, let's first define our factors."

    "If $y_t$ represent an asset return at time t, the linear factor model can help us interpret the source of the asset return and attribute it to the factor returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are interested in explaining the asset returns with a five-factor model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) World Equities: MSCI All World market capitalization weighted index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) 10 Year US Treasury: Return of 10 year US Treasury Bond\n",
    "\n",
    "3) High Yield: BOFA Merrill Lynch Global High Yield Index\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Inflation Protection: This is a \"style\" factor that considers the difference between real and nominal returns, thus balances the need for both.  It's the return of the TIPS bond minus the a weighted average of Treasury Bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Currency Protection: This is also an exchange rate factor, capturing the value of the dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, the first three factors can be thought of as surrogates for asset pricing models (earnings, risk free interest rates, and a risk premium).  The other two factors are driven by the importance of international investments (currency protection) and the need to understand inflation effects (inflation protection).   \n"

This is in keeping with previously mentioned Stein paradox.  In this context, the Stein paradox states that when estimating more than 3 parameters, OLS regression leads to larger mean squared error than other methods.  In short, we will introduce a penalty as a way to decrease overall error.\n",

For the sake of intuition, imagine if we could penalize the number of non-zero factor loadings we add to the model.  In that instance we would expect that the model would only consider the variables that really influence Y, and ignore the noise variables.  LASSO regression (defined below) does exactly that.\n",

    "In short, we are using the vector z to keep track of which factor loadings the model picks to be non-zero.  The elements of z can only be zero or 1.  So the first constraint (on the left) says that you can have at maximum only max_vars elements of z equal to 1.  The next two constraints enforce the condition that if an element of z is equal to 0, then the corresponding factor loading in $\\beta$ must be equal to zero.  The second constraint says that if an element of z is equal to zero, then the corresponding element of $\\beta$ must be less than or equal to zero.  Similarly, the third constraint says that if an element of z is equal to zero, the corresponding element of $\\beta$ must be greater than or equal to zero.  Combined, those two constraints imply that the corresponding element of $\\beta$ must be equal to zero.  If the element of z is equal to 1, then the constraints say the corresponding element of $\\beta$ is between -M and M.  If M is large enough, this constraint is not binding.\n",

### About this Coursera Specialization offered by EDHEC Business School

The Data Science and Machine Learning for Asset Management Specialization has been designed to deliver a broad and comprehensive introduction 
to modern methods in Investment Management, with a particular emphasis on the use of data science and machine learning techniques to improve 
investment decisions.By the end of this specialization, you will have acquired the tools required for making sound investment decisions, with an 
emphasis not only on the foundational theory and underlying concepts, but also on practical applications and implementation. Instead of merely 
explaining the science, we help you build on that foundation in a practical manner, with an emphasis on the hands-on implementation of those 
ideas in the Python programming language through a series of dedicated lab sessions.

### Course 1      Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python
#### Taught by: Vijay Vaidyanathan and Lionel Martellini

The practice of investment management has been transformed in recent years by computational methods. This course provides an introduction to the 
underlying science, with the aim of giving you a thorough understanding of that scientific basis. However, instead of merely explaining the science, 
we help you build on that foundation in a practical manner, with an emphasis on the hands-on implementation of those ideas in the Python programming 
language. We'll start with the very basics of risk and return and quickly progress to cover a range of topics including several Nobel Prize winning concepts. We'll cover some of the most popular practical techniques in modern, state of the art investment management and portfolio construction.

### Course 3      Python and Machine Learning for Asset Management 
#### Taught by: John Mulvey and Lionel Martellini

This course will enable you mastering machine-learning approaches in the area of investment management. It has been designed by two thought leaders in their 
field, Lionel Martellini from EDHEC-Risk Institute and John Mulvey from Princeton University. Starting from the basics, they will help you build practical 
skills to understand data science so you can make the best portfolio decisions.The course will start with an introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning, followed by an in-depth discussion of the application of these techniques to portfolio management decisions, including the design of more robust factor models, the construction of portfolios with improved diversification benefits, 
and the implementation of more efficient risk management models. 


      WEEK 1  Introducing the fundamentals of machine learning
      WEEK 2  Machine learning techniques for robust estimation of factor models
      WEEK 3  Machine learning techniques for efficient portfolio diversification
      WEEK 4  Machine learning techniques for regime analysis 
      WEEK 5  Identifying recessions, crash regimes and feature selection
 

### Course 4    Python and Machine-Learning for Asset Management with Alternative Data Sets
#### Taught by:  Gideon Ozik and Sean McOwen

Over-utilization of market and accounting data over the last few decades has led to portfolio crowding, mediocre performance and systemic risks, 
incentivizing financial institutions which are looking for an edge to quickly adopt alternative data as a substitute to traditional data. This course 
introduces the core concepts around alternative data, the most recent research in this area, as well as practical portfolio examples and actual applications.
The approach of this course is somewhat unique because while the theory covered is still a main component, practical lab sessions and examples of working 
with alternative datasets are also key. This course is fo you if you are aiming at carreers prospects as a data scientist in financial markets, are looking
to enhance your analytics skillsets to the financial markets, or if you are interested in cutting-edge technology and research as  they apply to big data. 
The required background is: Python programming, Investment theory , and Statistics. This course will enable you to learn new data and research techniques
applied to the financial markets while strengthening data science and python skills.

      WEEK 1  Consumption
      WEEK 2  Textual Analysis for Financial Applications
      WEEK 3  Processing Corporate Filings
      WEEK 4  Using Media-Derived Data
